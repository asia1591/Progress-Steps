### **At the beginning, we are greeted by a screen with the first of the progress steps selected and "prev" button is not active.** ![][img1]

### **When the "next" button is pressed, the progress steps also progress. Also the "prev" button becomes active.** ![][img2]

### **When the progress steps are reached, the "next" button is deactivated. Note: the "prev" button also works fine.** ![][img3]
